# ButterySlack
A material design Slack client, made by the butter enthusaists for the butter enthusaists ;)

## Setup

### Building the Project
To build the client, first head over to [this page](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) and make a legacy API token. Once you have obtained a token, add it to the app as a string resource with the name "token". These tokens provide access to your private data and that of your team. **DO NOT** UPLOAD THEM TO GITHUB BY ACCIDENT (or on purpose but I'm not sure what you'd hope to accomplish by doing that) OR SHARE THEM WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN YOURSELF.

This is a **temporary** solution to provide ButterySlack with access to your account and will be revised before the project is complete.
